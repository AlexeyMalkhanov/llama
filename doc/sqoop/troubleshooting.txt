Sqoop's output is emitted via log4j, a logging system for Java
that is used by other components of Hadoop. If Sqoop is failing
to import your tables correctly, you can enable more verbose logging
by adding the following line to +/etc/hadoop/conf/log4j.properties+:

----
log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.sqoop=DEBUG
----

If you continue to have trouble using Sqoop, drop us a line on our
