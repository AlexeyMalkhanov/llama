      and installing a single tool.

      These objects may define (during their c'tor phase) the dependencies
      they hold on other tools. Dependencies are indicated by specifying
      the toolName(s) they depend on. The ToolInstall objects must be
      instantiated in-order (it is up to you to define the topological
      sort over the implicit DAG). The dependencies are checked that the
      required prerequisite ToolInstalls already are in the lits.

      The installation process is conducted in 5 stages. These stages are
      applied "horizontally": one phase is applied to all ToolInstall objects
      before the next phase is applied to any of them.

        precheck     - check any system-wide preconditions
        configure    - any configuration for the tool, solicit all user input
        install      - do the installation itself.
          (implicit stage: run any remote deployment here by running the
           installer tool with appropriate --unattend cmdline args on remote
           machines here)
        postInstall  - any final setup stages that depend on everything being
                       installed
