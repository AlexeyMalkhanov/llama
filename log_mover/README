This project is meant to move logs from a single place, for example a Scribe
central server or a directory that contains RSYNCed files, temporarily in to
MySQL for reporting purposes.  This project is also capable of pruning the
MySQL tables to ensure that they don't get too large.  Lastly, this project
is capable of persisting old log files to HDFS.

This project is also very pluggable.  As it stands now, it only deals
with vmstat logs that are collected by Scribe.  This is a silly use
case, because vmstat provides statistics that monitoring software
such as Hyperic or Nagios could provide.  However, it provides a good
example for using this framework for other log collection.

Usage:
Database initializers:
db_user_and_db.sql - creates a user and database
db_init.sql        - creates tables
Usage:
1) log_to_db.py    - parses logs and puts them in MySQL
2) prune.py        - prune the MySQL tables
3) persist.py      - persist old logs to HDFS

Each of these scripts should be attached to a cron job.  It is recommended
that log_to_db.py is run every minute, prune.py is run as often as you would
like things pruned (this is also defined as a constant in each pruner), and
persist.py is run every few hours or so.
