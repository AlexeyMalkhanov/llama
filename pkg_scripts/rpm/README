    Hadoop - Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and
    run applications that process vast amounts of data.

SYNOPSIS
    Usage: hadoop [--config confdir] COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
    Here's what makes Hadoop especially useful:

    Scalable
        Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.

    Economical
        It distributes the data and processing across clusters of commonly
        available computers. These clusters can number into the thousands of
        nodes.

    Efficient
        By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel on the
        nodes where the data is located. This makes it extremely rapid.

    Reliable
        Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and
        automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.

    Hadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System
    (HDFS) (see figure below.) MapReduce divides applications into many
    small blocks of work. HDFS creates multiple replicas of data blocks for
    reliability, placing them on compute nodes around the cluster. MapReduce
    can then process the data where it is located.

    For more details about hadoop, see the Hadoop Wiki at
    http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/.

OPTIONS
    --config configdir
        Overrides the "HADOOP_CONF_DIR" environment variable. See
        "ENVIRONMENT" section below.

COMMANDS
    namenode -format
        format the DFS filesystem

    secondarynamenode i
        run the DFS secondary namenode

    namenode
        run the DFS namenode

    datanode
        run a DFS datanode

    dfsadmin
        run a DFS admin client

    fsck
        run a DFS filesystem checking utility

    fs  run a generic filesystem user client

    balancer
        run a cluster balancing utility

    jobtracker
        run the MapReduce job Tracker node

    pipes
        run a Pipes job

    tasktracker
        run a MapReduce task Tracker node

    job manipulate MapReduce jobs

    version
        print the version

    jar <jar>
        run a jar file

    distcp <srcurl> <desturl>
        copy file or directories recursively

    archive -archiveName NAME <src>* <dest>
        create a hadoop archive

    daemonlog
        get/set the log level for each daemon

    CLASSNAME
        run the class named CLASSNAME

    Most commands print help when invoked w/o parameters.

FILES
    /etc/hadoop/config
        This symbolic link points to the currently active Hadoop
        configuration directory. This link is managed by the alternatives(8)
        command. Hadoop system administrators can deploy new Hadoop
        configurations manually or by installing a Hadoop configuration RPM.

        To manually manage alternative configurations...

    /etc/hadoop/config/hadoop-site.xml
        This is the path to the currently deployed Hadoop site
        configuration. See "/etc/hadoop/config" above.

    /usr/bin/hadoop-config.sh
        This script searches for a useable "JAVA_HOME" location if
        "JAVA_HOME" is not already set. It also sets up environment
        variables that Hadoop components need at startup (see "ENVIRONMENT"
        section).

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-namenode
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop NameNode.

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-datanode
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop DataNode.

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-secondarynamenode
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop Secondary
        NameNode

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-jobtracker
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop JobTracker

    /etc/init.d/hadoop-tasktracker
        Service script for starting and stopping the Hadoop TaskTracker

ENVIRONMENT
        JAVA_HOME
            Hadoop will honor the location of your "JAVA_HOME" environment
            variable. Hadoop requires Sun Java 1.6.

        HADOOP_CONF_DIR
            The location of the Hadoop configuration files. Defaults to
            "/etc/hadoop/config". For more details, see the "FILES" section.

EXAMPLES
           $ mkdir input
           $ cp <txt files> input
           $ hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop/*example*.jar input output 'grep string'
           $ cat output/*
